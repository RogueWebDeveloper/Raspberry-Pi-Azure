The Obstacle Avoidance sensor module will read 0 when there is an obstacle within itself detection distance, and a 1 when there is not. To adjust the detection distance of the module, use a tool(preferably a screwdriver) to turn the dial on top of the sensor. After having adjusted it multiple times, the best distance I was able to pick up was about 4 to 5 inches.
To run the script, use the command:
'Python ObstacleAvoidance.py'
When an obstacle is detected the Led light will turn on, and will turn off when no obstacle is detected.
To stop the script, press 'Ctrl + C'
